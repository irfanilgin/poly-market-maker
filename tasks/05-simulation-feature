# Task: Validation - Connect to Real Market Data

**Objective:**
Prove that the `ShadowBook` can be driven by the **Real Polymarket WebSocket**, not just manual loop updates. Stop generating fake price updates in the simulation loop. We are moving from "Unit Test Mode" to "Shadow Mode".

**The Problem:**
The previous logs showed `WebSocket error: [Errno 11001]`. This usually means the `host` URL is wrong or the Token ID does not map to a valid market on the server, causing the connection to drop.

**Instructions:**
1.  **Remove the Loop:** Delete the code in `main.py` (or the simulation function) that manually generates `Simulating price update: Bid=...`.
2.  **Data Source:** The `ShadowBook` must ONLY be updated by the `_thread_refresh_order_book` or the WebSocket callback.

**Goal:**
I want to run `python main.py --simulate --token-id <REAL_ID>` and see the bot sitting silently, logging "Virtual Fill" ONLY when the *actual* Polymarket price moves across my order levels.

**Steps:**
1.  **I provided you a valid condition_id:**
    * Using this condition_id: Print the `token_id` (the large integer) for the "YES" outcome.
    * Run the simulation mode with this condition_id

3.  **Success Criteria:**
    * No `getaddrinfo` errors.
    * You should see a stream of `Updating market data: Bid=... Ask=...` that matches the actual price on the Polymarket website.
    * **Constraint:** Do not modify the strategy logic yet. Just verify the data pipe is open.
